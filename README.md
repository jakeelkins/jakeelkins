## Jake Elkins
I am a current PhD student in the Advanced Robotics Lab at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, supervised by Dr. Farbod Fahimi. I am also a current National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow, class of 2021. I am currently working on online-learning based control systems (merging well-known, proven control strategies of old with modern machine learning to get a proven, stable controller that gets better over time and adapts to novel information). I am also currently working on getting these controllers on actual hardware.
