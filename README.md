### welcome to the show
- studying learning-based controllers, merging the proven controls of old with modern ML
- how can we prove controllers with learning-based elements?
- what if a human is in the loop? then what...
- online learning? how does a controller adapt to new information without disregarding the old

#### current work:
- putting one of my controllers on a new servo we have in our lab (RMD-X8 1:6)
- learning ROS2 and C++...why did I just dev my own C++ linear algebra library...whoops
